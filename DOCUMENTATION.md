# ðŸ§© ROI Calculator â€“ Approach Documentation

## **Overview**
A lightweight ROI calculator web app that helps businesses estimate cost savings, payback period, and ROI when switching from manual to automated invoicing.  
It combines a simple input form, live simulation, scenario storage, and a downloadable report to visually demonstrate automationâ€™s advantage.

## **Flow of Application**
1. User enters key business inputs (invoice volume, staff, wages, etc.) on the frontend.  
2. Frontend sends data to backend `/simulate` API.  
3. Backend applies internal constants and calculation logic to return ROI results favoring automation.  
4. User can save, load, or delete scenarios from the database.  
5. To download a report, the user must enter an email.  
6. Backend generates a PDF/HTML report with simulation results.
